# Introduction
# Files are a great way to save and reload a game, so weâ€™ll give it a shot here by building Hangman.

# Assignment
# You will be building a command line Hangman game where one player plays against the computer, but a bit more advanced.
# 
# 8 Guesses allowed
# display blanks for word before game starts
# 
$guesses_allowed = 8

# Model
# 
## Sets up game by selecting hangman word
def setup_game
  word_array = Array.new()
  # import txt file
  fd = IO.sysopen('C:\Users\simmojx7\dev\odinProject\assets\google-10000-english-no-swears.txt')
  word_sheet = IO.new(fd)

  puts "------------"
  puts "WELCOME TO HANGMAN!"
  puts "------------"

    # filter and save words to array
    if word_length >= 5 && word_length <= 12
      word_array << word
    end
  end
  word_sheet.close

  # randomly select word between 5-12 characters
  $hangman_word = word_array[rand(word_array.length)]

  # puts "Your hangman word is #{$hangman_word}"
  $placeholder_word = "_" * $hangman_word.length
  puts "Your word is #{$placeholder_word.length.to_s} characters long"
end

# View

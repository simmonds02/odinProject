# We will explain an example of how an enumerable works to give you an idea of how to start tackling these methods. 
# Specifically we’re going to break down the #find enumerable method. 
# The #find method finds the first element that matches the given block’s condition and returns it. 
# If one isn’t found, it returns nil.

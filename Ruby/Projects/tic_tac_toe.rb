# Build a tic-tac-toe game on the command line 
# where two human players can play against each other 
# and the board is displayed in between turns.
# 
# Think about how you would set up the different elements within the gameâ€¦ What should be a class? 
# Instance variable? Method? A few minutes of thought can save you from wasting an hour of coding.
# Build your game, taking care to not share information between classes any more than you have to.
# Post your solution below, then check out this example Tic Tac Toe solution from RosettaCode.org.
# 
# 1. Create a board class that will hold the state of the game
# 2. Create a player class that holds the state of a players moves
# 3.  
# 
# Classes - board
# Instances - boards
# Methods - take turn, start game, end game, display board, get player turn
#
